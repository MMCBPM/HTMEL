The Digital Adventures of MEL
This is a WIP of my digital adventures: an experienced marketer navigating through the complex world of SQMEL, HTMEL and EMEL and a bit of Javascript - all because I decided to leave my career, family and life behind for the Bay Area. I am here to make America great, again.
